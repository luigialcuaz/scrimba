const [currentNoteId, setCurrentNoteId] = React.useState(
    (notes[0] && notes[0].id) || ""
)

- notes[0] is undefined when the app initializes and sayinn notes[0].id is undefined.id which will throw an error
- the line makes sure notes[0] exists first

const [notes, setNotes] = React.useState(
    JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("notes")) || []

- everytime the app renders, react will reach into localstorage when we've already initialized the app
- we need to use lazy state Initialization to make it run only the first time

const [notes, setNotes] = React.useState(
    () => JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("notes")) || []
)

- provide the function that returns the value
    function {
        return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("notes"))
     }
