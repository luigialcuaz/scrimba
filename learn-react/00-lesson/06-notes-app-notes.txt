const [currentNoteId, setCurrentNoteId] = React.useState(
    (notes[0] && notes[0].id) || ""
)

- notes[0] is undefined when the app initializes and sayinn notes[0].id is undefined.id which will throw an error
- the line makes sure notes[0] exists first

const [notes, setNotes] = React.useState(
    JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("notes")) || []

- everytime the app renders, react will reach into localstorage when we've already initialized the app
- we need to use lazy state Initialization to make it run only the first time

const [notes, setNotes] = React.useState(
    () => JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("notes")) || []
)

- provide the function that returns the value
    function {
        return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("notes"))
     }

function deleteNote(event, noteId) {
    event.stopPropagation()
    // Your code here
}

- there are two events happening, when clicking on the trash can to delete the note, react also thinks you are using the parent event which selects the note when you click in the area. after deleting this throws an error
-this stops propagating the click event to the parents so only delete happens

onClick={(event) => props.deleteNote(event, note.id)}

- events pass the event as a param to functions automatically, to add more params, turn it into a func
