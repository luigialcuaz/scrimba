1. Why do we need to `import React from "react"` in our files?
  React defines JSX. Otherwise, jsk would return a js object

2. If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?
  A JavaScript object. React elements that describe what React should
  eventually add to the real DOM for us.

4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?
  Declarative means I can tell the computer WHAT to do 
  and expect it to handle the details. Imperative means I need
  to tell it HOW to do each step.

5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?
  We have small pieces that we can put together to make something
  larger/greater than the individual pieces.

1. What is a React component?
  A function that returns React elements. (UI)
