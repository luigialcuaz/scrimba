css-variables 

Whenever you css values are being reused, it is a perfect time to start using css-variables

decide which scope we want our variable to live in

:root {
  --red: #ff6f69;
  --beige: #ffeead;
  --yellow: #ffcc5c;
}

a pseudo class that points to the root element of our document (the html element itself in many cases)
declaring it here will make them global variables, available through the entire app

html,
body {
  background: var(--beige);
  color: var(--red);
}

using requires var() with variable inside the parenthesis
